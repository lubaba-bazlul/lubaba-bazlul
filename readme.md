## 🎓 About Me

I am driven by a commitment to humanitarian technology research that facilitates people of all ages and educational backgrounds through thoughtful technological interventions. My work centers on designing systems that prioritize optimized user interactions, particularly for underserved communities.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have focused on user-centric technology for social impact. My research has explored critical humanitarian challenges, from conducting focus group studies with Rohingya refugees and healthcare workers to understand mental health interventions, to developing CNN-based detection models for domestic violence victims. With over five years as a Technical Product Owner at leading organizations like bKash and Grameenphone, I have designed products serving millions of users with varying digital literacy levels, achieving significant growth through data-driven, empathetic design.

**Current Focus:** Pursuing graduate studies in Human-Computer Interaction and Human-Centered AI to investigate methods for designing inclusive, accessible technologies that bridge the gap between advanced AI systems and diverse user needs.
