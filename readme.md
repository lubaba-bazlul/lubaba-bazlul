## üéì About Me

I am driven by a commitment to humanitarian technology research that facilitates people of all ages and educational backgrounds through thoughtful technological interventions. My work centers on designing systems that prioritize optimized user interactions, particularly for underserved communities.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have focused on user-centric technology for social impact. My research has explored critical humanitarian challenges, from conducting focus group studies with Rohingya refugees and healthcare workers to understand mental health interventions, to developing CNN-based detection models for domestic violence victims. With over five years as a Technical Product Owner at leading organizations like bKash and Grameenphone, I have designed products serving millions of users with varying digital literacy levels, achieving significant growth through data-driven, empathetic design.

**Current Focus:** Pursuing graduate studies in Human-Computer Interaction and Human-Centered AI to investigate methods for designing inclusive, accessible technologies that bridge the gap between advanced AI systems and diverse user needs.

## üí° Featured Projects

### üö® Domestic Violence Detection using Deep Learning

**Capstone Project | North South University | IEEE YESIST12 Finalist 2019**

Developed a CNN-based model to classify violent acts in videos and integrated it with an IoT alert system for timely assistance to victims. This project addresses the societal issue of domestic violence by notifying predetermined contacts when violent behavior is detected, combining user experience design with the need for instant support while ensuring data integrity.

**Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, OpenCV, Python, IoT, Raspberry Pi  
**Impact:** Finalist at IEEE YESIST12 Maker Fair, Thailand
